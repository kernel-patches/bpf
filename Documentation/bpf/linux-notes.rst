Linux implementation notes
==========================

This document provides more details specific to the Linux kernel implementation of the eBPF instruction set.

Registers and calling convention
================================

All program types only use R1 which contains the "context", which is typically a structure containing all
the inputs needed, and the exit value for eBPF programs is passed as a 32 bit value.

Arithmetic instructions
=======================

While the eBPF instruction set document uses the standard C terminology as the cross-platform specification,
in the Linux kernel, uint32_t is expressed as u32, uint64_t is expressed as u64, etc.

Byte swap instructions
======================

``BPF_FROM_LE`` and ``BPF_FROM_BE`` exist as aliases for ``BPF_TO_LE`` and ``BPF_TO_BE`` respectively.

Map objects
===========

Linux only supports the 'mva(map)' operation on array maps with a single element.

Variables
=========

Linux uses BTF ids to identify variables.

Legacy BPF Packet access instructions
=====================================

As mentioned in the `ISA standard documentation <instruction-set.rst#legacy-bpf-packet-access-instructions>`_,
Linux has special eBPF instructions for access to packet data that have been
carried over from classic BPF to retain the performance of legacy socket
filters running in the eBPF interpreter.

The instructions come in two forms: ``BPF_ABS | <size> | BPF_LD`` and
``BPF_IND | <size> | BPF_LD``.

These instructions are used to access packet data and can only be used when
the program context is a pointer to a networking packet.  ``BPF_ABS``
accesses packet data at an absolute offset specified by the immediate data
and ``BPF_IND`` access packet data at an offset that includes the value of
a register in addition to the immediate data.

These instructions have seven implicit operands:

* Register R6 is an implicit input that must contain a pointer to a
  struct sk_buff.
* Register R0 is an implicit output which contains the data fetched from
  the packet.
* Registers R1-R5 are scratch registers that are clobbered by the
  instruction.

These instructions have an implicit program exit condition as well. If an
eBPF program attempts access data beyond the packet boundary, the
program execution will be aborted.

``BPF_ABS | BPF_W | BPF_LD`` (0x20) means::

  R0 = ntohl(*(u32 *) ((struct sk_buff *) R6->data + imm))

where ``ntohl()`` converts a 32-bit value from network byte order to host byte order.

``BPF_IND | BPF_W | BPF_LD`` (0x40) means::

  R0 = ntohl(*(u32 *) ((struct sk_buff *) R6->data + src + imm))
