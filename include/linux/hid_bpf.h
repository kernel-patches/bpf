 * struct hid_bpf_ctx - User accessible data for all HID programs
 *
 * ``data`` is not directly accessible from the context. We need to issue
 * a call to ``hid_bpf_get_data()`` in order to get a pointer to that field.
 *
 * All of these fields are currently read-only.
 *
 * @index: program index in the jump table. No special meaning (a smaller index
 *         doesn't mean the program will be executed before another program with
 *         a bigger index).
 * @hid: the ``struct hid_device`` representing the device itself
 * @report_type: used for ``hid_bpf_device_event()``
 * @allocated_size: Allocated size of data.
 *
 *                  This is how much memory is available and can be requested
 *                  by the HID program.
 *                  Note that for ``HID_BPF_RDESC_FIXUP``, that memory is set to
 *                  ``4096`` (4 KB)
 * @size: Valid data in the data field.
 *
 *        Programs can get the available valid size in data by fetching this field.
 *        Programs can also change this value by returning a positive number in the
 *        program.
 *        To discard the event, return a negative error code.
 *
 *        ``size`` must always be less or equal than ``allocated_size`` (it is enforced
 *        once all BPF programs have been run).
 * @retval: Return value of the previous program.
