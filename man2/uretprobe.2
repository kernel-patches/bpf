.TH uretprobe 2 (date) "Linux man-pages (unreleased)"
.SH NAME
uretprobe \- execute pending return uprobes
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B int uretprobe(void)
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Kernel is using
.BR uretprobe()
syscall to trigger uprobe return probe consumers instead of using
standard breakpoint instruction.

The uretprobe syscall is not supposed to be called directly by user, it's allowed
to be invoked only through user space trampoline provided by kernel.
When called from outside of this trampoline, the calling process will receive
.BR SIGILL .

.SH RETURN VALUE
.BR uretprobe()
return value is specific for given architecture.

.SH VERSIONS
This syscall is not specified in POSIX,
and details of its behavior vary across systems.
.SH STANDARDS
None.
.SH NOTES
.BR uretprobe()
syscall is initially introduced on x86-64 architecture, because doing syscall
is faster than doing breakpoint trap on it. It might be extended to other
architectures.

.BR uretprobe()
syscall exists only to allow the invocation of return uprobe consumers.
It should
.B never
be called directly.
Details of the arguments (if any) passed to
.BR uretprobe ()
and the return value are specific for given architecture.
