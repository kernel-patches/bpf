Subject: [PATCH] selftests/bpf: Set CONFIG_BOOTPARAM_HUNG_TASK_PANIC
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

With commit 5ed88f81511ce ("selftests/bpf: Panic on hard/soft lockup")
we enabled the means to panic test runs quickly when they are stuck
because of a hard or soft lockup. What we did not include is the means
to do the same when a hung task is detected. The reasoning there was
that virtualization effects may lead to delays and, hence, spurious
failures.
However, we see the occasional CI timeout when running the test_progs
selftest with internal parallelism enabled (-j) that is not caused by a
hard or soft lockup but due to a hung task. Hence, it makes sense to
enable this detection as well. But let's give it some mileage first
before upstreaming, though, and only include it in BPF CI.
